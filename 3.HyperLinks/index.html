                Introduction
                Interlinking, also known as internal linking, is the practice of linking one page of a website to another page on the same website. This is an essential part of website development and SEO (Search Engine Optimization), as it helps in easy navigation, improves user experience, and enhances search engine rankings.
                What is Interlinking?
                Interlinking involves adding hyperlinks within a website that connect various pages. These links are placed within the content, menus, footers, or sidebars to create a structured and well-connected website. Unlike external links, which lead users to other websites, internal links keep visitors engaged within the same site.
                Importance of Interlinking
                1. Enhances Website Navigation
                Internal links help users navigate a website easily. When a visitor reads an article or views a product, they may want to explore related content. Interlinking allows them to do so without searching manually.

                2. Boosts SEO Ranking
                Search engines like Google use web crawlers to index content. A well-structured interlinking strategy helps search engines discover and rank pages efficiently. Pages with multiple internal links often get indexed faster and rank higher in search results.

                3. Improves User Experience
                A website that offers well-placed internal links keeps visitors engaged for a longer time. This reduces bounce rates and increases session duration, which is a key factor in user satisfaction.

                4. Helps Distribute Page Authority
                Page authority (or link equity) determines how much value a page carries in terms of SEO. When high-authority pages link to lower-ranking pages, the authority is distributed, boosting the overall ranking of the website.

                5. Supports Content Discoverability
                Websites with a large number of pages may have hidden or deep-linked content that is hard to find. Internal linking ensures that important pages remain accessible and discoverable by both users and search engines.

                Best Practices for Effective Interlinking
                1. Use Descriptive Anchor Text
                Anchor text is the clickable text of a hyperlink. Instead of using generic terms like "click here" or "read more," use relevant keywords that describe the linked page. Example:
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>


    <h2 style="text-align: center;" id="section2" >Section 2</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="para">
